1 - What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
To pause the code/test running at a specified point/line and launch debugger console. Allowing you to debug lines of code, make changes etc. Until Resume is selected to resume program.

2 - Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No the line will not run until we select Step Into

3 - How do we debug the next line of code?
In the debugging tools, select Step Over

4 - What does the step into command do?
Step Into runs the line of code at the breakpoint

5 - What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression runs methods on instances of objects created. (no ; required)

Code Fragment Mode will run multiple lines of code and create variables to store lines of code. (Normal Java ;)

PS. How stressful was it when you seen low battery at the end of the video?!
